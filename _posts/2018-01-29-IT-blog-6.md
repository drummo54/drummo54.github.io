**IT blog 6**

In today's lesson we went straight into improving our google sheets shop. I added another stock column (amount) a stock sold column, stock unsold column, cost column, expenditure column, margin column, rent per month row, advertising row and an assistant row. After making some calculation via the google sheet I ended up with a total profit of Â£54,717.40 per month.

That was all I did in today's IT lesson.
