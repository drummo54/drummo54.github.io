**IT blog**

Lesson 1:

In today's lesson we started to look at google sheets and how you could use it to create a checkout for a shop. We started by making a list of items that our shop would sell and prices added to them. From there we tried to make a working checkout, I have not moved onto this yet.

Lesson 2:

In today's lesson we continued to work on creating a checkout on google sheets but now adding discounts. I didnâ€™t get onto the discounts as there was something wrong with my original work.

Lesson 3:

The objective of today's lesson was to create a new/ edit our old github account. To begin with I decided to edit my old blog page so to start I added a new background. After that I decided to delete all my old blog posts but as a result of this the blog file got deleted so now I have to make a new blog page.
