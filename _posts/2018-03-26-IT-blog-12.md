**IT blog 12**

In today's IT lesson we moved on from python with turtle to python three. We did this because the aim of this lesson was firstly to create a program which identified if a number was even or odd and secondly to find out weather a number was a prime number or not a prime number. I got them both to work however on my prime number program the break function isn't working properly therefore it said your number is prime multiple times if it was prime.

That was all we did in today's IT lesson.
