**IT blog 10**

In today's IT lesson we continued our python(with turtle) work on repl.it. In the lesson instead of doing shapes like last we week we learnt how to do letters and to finish we spelt out our initials. I successfully spelt out my initials but Iâ€™m not sure how to do it with gaps in between each letter. Today I also experimented with the width of my letter and the colour of my turtle.

That was all I did in today's IT lesson.
