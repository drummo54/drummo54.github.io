**IT lesson blog 13**

In today's IT lesson we started the new topic of buzzfeed quizzes. To start we went on to buzzfeed and did a quiz. After that we went through all the ways that we could and buzzfeed structure and code their quizzes. After that we started to create our own quizzes with a main question and 8 other questions which lead to the answer of the main question.

That was all we did in today's IT lesson.
