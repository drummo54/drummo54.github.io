**IT blog 5**

In today's lesson we continued on our spreadsheets for shop checkouts. I made a lot of progress today, before today I didnâ€™t have much working but now I have a scroll down for selection of clothes, a functioning quantity column, a functioning total and a functioning discount. Next week I am going to improve my quantity column so there is no problem when you put in 0.

That was all I did in today's IT lesson.
