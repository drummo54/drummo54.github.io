**IT blog 11**

In today's IT lesson we continued to look at python(with turtle). To start off todayâ€™s lesson we checked the homework. After that we moved on to the main part of the lesson which was drawing the outline of the letter T and making a 3D T. I made the outline very quickly but the 3D T took me longer but eventually I completed it. However I did use a lot of lines of code and I highly doubt my way is the most efficient way to make a 3D T.

That was all we did in today's IT lesson.
