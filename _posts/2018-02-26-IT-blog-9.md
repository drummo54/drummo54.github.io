**IT blog 9**

In today's IT lesson we entered a new topic of python(with turtle). In the lesson we learnt how to make shapes with the turtle in lots of different ways and eventually we created code so the turtle was continuously making a shape. To start with I couldnâ€™t get mine to work but after a couple of minutes of checking I realised I had missed out a space which had stopped my whole code from working.

That was all I did in today's IT lesson.
