**IT blog 7**

In today's IT Lesson we moved onto a new topic. The topic was making and deciphering codes using google sheets. To start with I struggled but eventually I worked out how to use the Vlookup to get some random letters in a pattern to translate to 'Hello Worldâ€™. After that I moved on to a different type of coding where you have a keyword and then the alphabet after it minus the letters it contains.

That was all I did in today's IT lesson.
