**IT blog 8**

In today's IT lesson we carried on with what we were doing in the last lesson for about half of the time. For the other half of the lesson we moved onto ascii, ascii code is changing numbers letters and symbols into binary code. We copy and pasted a table of a ascii code website which gave us all the symbols letters and numbers into binary code. However we had a problem some of the symbols were in 6 bit binary while the numbers and letters were in 7 bit binary, we wanted it all in 8 bit binary. Mr Tansley told us how to do this and I did it successfully.

This was all I did in today's IT lesson.
